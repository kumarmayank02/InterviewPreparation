//Interview Questions on Java Conditional Statements
/*

What are conditional statements in Java?

Difference between if-else and switch.

When would you prefer switch over if-else-if?

Can we use logical operators (&&, ||, !) in conditions?



Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

Write a program using switch-case to print the day of the week based on number input.

Convert an if-else block into a ternary operator.

Use nested if statements to check multiple conditions.

✅ Best Practices

Keep conditions simple and readable.

Use switch when you have multiple fixed values to compare (like days, menu options).

Avoid deep nesting (if inside if inside if) — use early return or better structure.

Use braces {} even for one-line if statements (for clarity).

In Java 14+, use enhanced switch expressions where appropriate.*/
